    <h2 class="Swrite">Swift: About Theo</h2>
    <p class="Swrite">
      We’ve unofficially made Theo our choreographer. He swears he only started
      dancing after I started teaching him, but he’s gotten so good that I find
      it hard to <a href="T-letter.html">believe</a>. And even if it were true,
      it’s obvious this is something he’s
      <a href="J-nightmares.html">dreamed</a> about, something he’s practiced over
      and over again in his mind for countless sleepless nights.
