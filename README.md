We Will Always Be Four is a non-linear story of four friends who found each other while each were going through their own struggles, and bonded over their mutual love of performing arts. The story is told through written memory snippets of just three out of the four friends. Clicking through the pages via the pink links slowly reveals the truth behind the missing fourth friend. This project is best viewed in fullscreen on a computer.
