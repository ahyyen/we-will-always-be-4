  <p class = "Swrite">
    Jullien and <a href = "nothinghere.html">Hallie</a> are the ones who got us all together, really. 
    Theyâ€™re the fearless ones, endlessly pursuing their dreams no matter the cost. 
    They always seem to know exactly how to say what they want to say, verbally or not. 
    I wish to be as expressive as <a href = "J-macarons.html">them</a>.
