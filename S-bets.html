    <p class="Swrite">
      There's this really dumb game that Hallie started between the four of us.
      Here's how it goes: one person bets against another person, and whoever
      wins has to then bet against a different person, and it just keeps going.
      The only rule is that the bets have to be relatively small and
      inconsequential. For example, once Theo bet $10 that I would not be able
      to finish eating an plate of pasta while staying en pointe. I have
      to say he greatly underestimated my capabilities.

      The last bet was between me and <a href="H-goodbye.html">Hallie</a>. I bet $15 that I could beat her
      in a game of blackjack. She was absolutely delighted that she now had an
      excuse to play cards again.
    </p>
    <p class="Swrite">
      ...Of course, that game never happened. I guess I owe Hallie $15.
