      Hallie was born with defective lungs. A cruel fate for someone so
      naturally energetic, daring, and outgoing. Someone who, above all, loved
      to sing. But Hallie was determined not to give up on her passion. Ever
      since she watched the characters in kids' shows sing their silly little
      songs, she knew she wanted to do the same. Even though she couldn't sing
      in the loud, powerful way she wanted to, she was determined to let the
      world hear her music. So Hallie sang.

      At first, however, it was more out of spite than anything else. Young
      Hallie cursed the universe for taking away the one thing she loved the
      most. She kept singing and singing, desperate to prove the universe wrong,
      desperate to defy her own fate. Then, one day, her lungs gave out and she
      collapsed. Laying in a hospital bed had a way of making one contemplate
      their life carefully. Hallie realized she had turned something she loved
      into a source of her hate, forgetting what inspired her to sing. She
      begged her younger self to forgive her, and when she was discharged from
      the hospital she began singing. For real this time.

      Despite all odds, Hallie ended up making it into Oak Valley Conservatory's
      music division. Eventually, by pure chance, she ran into Jullien, a theater
      student two years her junior.
