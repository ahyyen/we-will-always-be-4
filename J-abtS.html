    <p class="Jwrite">
      At first, Swift wasn’t called Swift. Her name was Hesper. But that name
      was everything she wasn’t — a feeling I understand too well — so we all
      pitched in to help her pick a new name. In the end, <a href = "nothinghere.html">Hallie</a> was the one who
      suggested “Swift.” Because “I hope all of your wishes swiftly come
      <a href = "truth.html"> true</a>.”
      And Swift stuck with it.
