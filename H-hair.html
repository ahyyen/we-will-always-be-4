      You know who gave Swift's hair a glorious makeover? MEEE!
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      Well okay I didn't do it alone, Theo had to come in at the end to polish
      everything up. Okay ACTUALLY-actually I was under Theo's guidance the
      whole time. Apparently he cuts his hair himself. No wonder it looks so
      wacky - I'M KIDDING SORRY THEO LOL
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      But yeah, Swift was complaining about how her long hair was getting in the
      way all the time even if she puts it in a ponytail, so then her only option
      left is to put it in a bun but she HATES putting her hair in a bun. So I
      was like why don't you just chop it off? I meant it kind of as a joke so I
      didn't expect her to actually take the suggestion. Theo offered to cut it
      for her if that's what she really wanted. Then I saw my opportunity to do
      something fun and volunteered to help as well. Yay!
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      But yeah now Swift has a SICK BLUE UNDERCUT. That's right, we dyed it too!
      Now she'll be extra easy to <a href="H-goodbye.html">find</a> in a crowd.
