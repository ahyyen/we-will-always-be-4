      According to Jullien, being a magician is just another form of acting. If
      you don't believe in the tricks you're performing, then your audience will
      see right through you. Being a magician isn't just about performing tricks
      - it's about playing a character, embodying the role of a magician.

      Jullien grew up near his local theater, and so was surrounded by all kinds
      of shows from an early age. He was particularly fascinated by magic shows
      and musicals, which then inspired his own passion for performing. He is
      now a second-year theater student at the renown Oak Valley Conservatory to
      pursue this passion (what he really wanted was to be a magician but
      unfortunately such a specific department didn't exist). 
      Outside of class he often goes out to perform little shows on the city
      streets, which tends to attract a lot of local children. But, really, his
      shows are for audiences of all ages. That was how he met Swift, who he
      then introduced to Hallie.
