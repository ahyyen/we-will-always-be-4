      Hesper Rae was born to a family of scientists. She and her
      two siblings were each expected to carry on that legacy. Her siblings
      gladly obliged; she refused to do the same. She rejected everything to do
      with her family, including the name they gave her.
    </p>

    <p>
      But doing so left her completely empty. She had no dreams, no goals, no
      plan for her future aside from a vague "not scientist". She often found
      herself aimlessly wandering through the city streets, not knowing what she
      was searching for. One day, when she was thirteen years old, she came across a
      ballet performance on an outdoor stage at a park. Instantly, she fell in
      love with the elegance and beauty of the dance, unable to take her eyes
      away for the entire show. That evening, she managed to strike a deal with
      her parents: if they let her take ballet lessons, she would study to
      become a scientist like they always wanted.
    </p>

      Several years down the line, she discovered an interest in acrobatics as
      well, which her ballet teacher encouraged her to explore. That was how she
      met a fellow aspiring acrobat named Theo. Eventually they met two other
      young performers, and through her new friends, Swift finally found her new name.
