      Dear Benjamin,
    </p>
    <p class = "Twrite">
      I wish you could meet my <a href = "J-macarons.html">friends</a>. I think you’d like them a lot. 
      There’s this cheerful, headstrong boy named Jullien, who has honestly said some 
      of the most hilarious, out-of-pocket things I’ve ever heard. Then there’s Swift, the one who introduced me to dance, 
      and also loves muffins as much as you did. And <a href = "nothinghere.html">Hallie</a>…yeah. There’s three of them. It’s not wrong to call 
      them my saviors. I think, maybe, they could have been yours, too.
    </p>
    <p class = "Twrite">
      With love,
    </p>
    <p class = "Twrite">
      Your younger brother, Theo
    </p>
