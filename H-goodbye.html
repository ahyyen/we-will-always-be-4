    <p class="Hwrite">Dear my wonderful friends,</p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      If you are reading this, that probably means I am dead.
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      Wait that's literally so clich√© wtf, hold on let's start over. Ahem.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="Hwrite">
      To the best, most wonderful friends I could ever ask for:
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      I've always expected my time might come to an end without any warning. One
      day we'd all be together, laughing about stupid shit, singing, dancing,
      each telling our stories in our own unique ways. The next day, I'd be
      gone. When I first met all of you, that was my biggest fear - having to
      leave without saying goodbye. So I wrote a letter very much like this one.
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      Except that one sucked ass so I've rewritten it a bunch of times since
      then. And this is the final version I've come up with.
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      I guess I always knew that I should stay positive and live my life to the
      fullest. But, no matter how many times I told myself that, I still could
      never quite shake that dark, sinking feeling in my chest. It was only
      after meeting you guys that I truly realized what was precious to me, and
      how much I'd regret it if I spent my days wishing for a life I could never
      have.
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      So...I wanna say thank you to all three of you. I told you I've rewritten
      this countless times yet I still can't find the right words to express how
      truly happy I am that I met you guys. YOU GUYS ROCK! NEVER FORGET THAT!
      Jullien, I am waiting for you in the afterlife, and I WILL beat you at a
      card game for once! But seriously, you have incredible talent and if I
      were to have one regret it would be that I won't get to brag about being
      your friend when you become famous. Swift, I don't know if you realized or
      not but your dancing inspired a lot of my music. If you ever stop dancing
      I WILL rise from my grave to beat you back into it! Theo, I don't know how
      you did it but the mint lemonades you made were better than anything I've
      ever gotten from a store. You have to bury a detailed recipe with me so I
      can learn your secrets.
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      I better stop before this gets too long! Shouldn't keep you guys dwelling
      on the past, should I? Just remember, YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING AND I LOVE YOU
      AND I AM CHEERING YOU ON FROM THE OTHER SIDE! NEVER GIVE UP!!
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">
      I wish you all the best of luck! Don't miss me too much :p
    </p>
    <p class="Hwrite">With all the love in the world,</p>
