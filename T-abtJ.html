    <h2 class="Twrite">Theo: About Jullien</h2>
    <p class="Twrite">
      It took us a while to realize that, from the moment we first met Jullien,
      he was already acting. That he was so much more than the
      <a href="J-macarons.html">carefree, optimistic, silly</a>
      attitude he constantly displayed. I’m glad he’s able to reveal more of his
      true self to us now, but sometimes, I think it is only when he is on a
      <a href = "T-achieve.html"> stage</a>, reciting somebody else’s words, that his mask truly comes off.
