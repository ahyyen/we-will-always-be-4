    <p class="Jwrite">
      For a while, I never slept more than four hours a night. 
      Sometimes I just had so many thoughts and memories swirling around in my mind 
      that I couldn't fall asleep at all. Other times I finally did manage to fall asleep 
      after a long while, only to find myself suddenly awake again, out of breath, 
      cold sweat coating my forehead, eyes frantically darting around my room 
      in <a href = "S-fearless.html">fear</a>. 
    </p>
    <p class="Jwrite">
      I was so tired all the damn time. I was sick of it. I almost gave up, 
      if I'm being honest. Haha.
    </p>
    <p class="Jwrite">
      But never again! I'm never giving up again. I won't let anyone else feel the 
      way I did. Especially them three.
