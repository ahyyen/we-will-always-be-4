    <p class="Swrite">
      Every time I dance, I feel warm. Not just in my cheeks as sweat runs down
      my face, but deeper. And whenever I <a href = "T-achieve.html">watch</a> the others, 
      so full of passion as they weave their stories out of nothing, that feeling stays. 
      I wish things could be this way <a href = "S-fearless.html">forever</a>.
