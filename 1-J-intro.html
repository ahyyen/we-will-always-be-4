    <p class="Jwrite">
      There are four of us. Four unlikely friends, united by chance and
      strengthened by <a href="S-dance.html">passion</a>! Oooooh sounds so
      dramatic, right? Like narration at the start of a show. But it’s true. In
      a way, meeting the three of them was the start of my show, my story. I
      don’t know where I’d be without them.
