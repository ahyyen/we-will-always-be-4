    <h2 class="Jwrite">Jullien: Macarons</h2>
    <p class="Jwrite">
      Did you know that, before we met, none of the others had ever tried macarons
      before? I say that’s simply unacceptable! Before I realized it myself, I
      had dragged all three of them to the bakery. Swift instantly fell in love
      with how cute and colorful the macarons were. Theo was hesitant at first (he
      doesn’t like sweets usually) but he eventually softened up to the
      coffee-flavored one. And judging by the way <a href = "nothinghere.html">Hallie</a> instantly went back to
      buy a whole box after finishing hers, I say that trip was a huge success,
      hehehe~
    </p>
    <p class="Jwrite">…It’s funny how <a href = "J-abtS.html">precious</a> the small things can be, huh?</p>
