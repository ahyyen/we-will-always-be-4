      Theo is responsible, mature, calm, and dedicated. Everyone looks up to him and sees him 
      as a natural leader when they first meet him. But what they don't realize is the sheer amount 
      of work it took to become the person he is today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Theo and his older brother Benjamin were raised by a single father, who was 
      rarely at home because of work. Theo grew up as an outcast, and he 
      quickly learned to suppress his emotions to help him attract as little attention 
      as possible. Of course, it hurt him to do so all the time, leading to violent 
      outbursts of anger any time something even mildly annoyed him. These outbursts 
      escalated to the point where he had to be expelled from high school.

      If Theo hadn't happened to stumble across an acrobatics performance at a local 
       fair that summer, he might have continued down his dark path. Luckily, the performance 
      captivated him, and he eventually found some lessons that he could afford. A couple 
      years later he met a dancer who was just beginning to get into acrobatics. Her name 
      was Hesper.
