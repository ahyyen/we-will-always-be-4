      We each have at least one oddly specific thing that makes us irrationally happy. 
      Hallie is obsessed with card games, but invite her for a game at a nice cafe at NIGHT 
      and she becomes extra ecstatic. For Jullien, all you need to do is give him a warm crispy croissant stuffed with corn, 
      mushrooms, and cheese and it'll make his entire week. Also if he sees pigeons and you 
      just happen to have some bread crumbs handy, his eyes will widen like a child if you 
      let him feed the pigeons. <a href="H-hair.html">Swift</a> was a tough one to figure out, but turns out she loves 
      anything colorful. One time I took her to this one bakery near my childhood <a href="J-karaoke.html">home</a>, and she 
      spent almost thirty minutes just standing there admiring the different colorfully decorated 
      cakes and pastries.

      Me? Um...I guess I like wearing dangly earrings. Too bad that doesn't mix well with acrobatics.
