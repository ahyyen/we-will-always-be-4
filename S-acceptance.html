      My name forever carries the promise you made me: that all my wishes may come
      true. But now, one wish will never come trueâ€”the wish that things will
      always be the same. I guess this is your way of telling me how foolish that wish
      was, huh? You may have acted all airheaded, but really you're one of the most 
      sensible out of all of us. Rest well. You deserve it. I'll miss you so much.
