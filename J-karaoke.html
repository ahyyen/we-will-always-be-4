    <h2 class="Jwrite">Jullien: Karaoke</h2>
    <p class="Jwrite">
      So we all know Hallie can't exert herself too much, so our options for
      where to hang out are limited. A lot of times we just go to her apartment,
      since that's where she's most comfortable and also where all her medical
      supplies are in case anything happens. But we could tell Hallie was
      getting bored of being cooped up in that house all the time, even if we
      were all there with her. So, after some discussion, me and Swift and Theo
      put our money together to buy a karaoke machine for her.

      She loved it! The day we brought it over to her place we ended up singing
      until 2am (we got a noise complaint from the people next door so we had to
      stop haha oops). We all slept over that night, and when I woke up the next
      morning I noticed Hallie, still sleeping, had her hand around one of the
      karaoke microphones.

      We still have karaoke sessions at Hallie's every now and then. She even
      started to give the other two some vocal coaching during those sessions.
      She really does <a href = "H-goodbye.html">love</a> singing.
