    <p class="Hwrite">
      I love my best friends! It's honestly kind of a miracle that I even 
      met any of them. All pure coincidence: I was just walking around campus and 
      I randomly started humming a song . Then, this guy named <a href = "H-abtJ.html">Jullien</a>
      approached me and told me that was his favorite song from his favorite musical. 
      And then, of course, things spiraled from there and now I have three incredible, 
      talented friends.
